A simple website checker written in Rust.
This code will ping to a website and print it the
check passes, if not failed. 

To write this code, the concepts in Rust like trait, generics,
struts, ownership, borrow-checkers were used. The comments are given
in src/main.rs


The code for lifetime is a simple experiment with String, &str, stack, 
heap and higher level abstractions like trait and struct.
